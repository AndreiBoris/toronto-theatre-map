# Plan

Look for cool APIs and test them in sterile environments.

Plan to make it work on cell phone.

## Steps

1. Get a KO text box working that allows me input text into my app. DONE
2. Get the Google Maps API on there. DONE
3. Get the search bar to appear on the map DONE
4. Set up some map markers - DONE
5. Set up basic console.log handlers to clicks on markers - DONE
6. Implement one marker that moves from marker to marker. Maybe create an 
observableArray(?) array of infoBoxes that opens a 'close all' button - DONE


### TODO

* Get twitter feed
* probably should apply Bootstrap classes to the content of the InfoWindows

### Working with Google Maps API

* might have to use subscribe Knockout function

### Other APIs

### Features

* Needs to be fairly simple for me to add more twitter accounts to the feed.
* Look into [Web Scraping](https://blog.hartleybrody.com/web-scraping/)
* Scrape Theatre Now and Mooney On theatre reviews?
* How to get there from TTC
* Robust site that won't get outdated if a theatre goes out of business or moves

### Responsive Design

* Make sure the map controls are useable on mobile.

### End Game

1. Does failure work? Unplug internet to test AJAX failures.
